'''This code creates a FallingLetter class that represents a single letter falling down the screen. It also creates a list called falling_letters to keep track of all the letters currently falling. The create_falling_letters function creates a new FallingLetter object and adds it to the list, then schedules itself to be called again after a random delay. The animate function moves each letter down the screen and removes any letters that have fallen off the bottom. It also schedules itself to be called again after a short delay.

To run this code, simply save it in a file with a .py extension (e.g. falling_letters.py) and run it from the command line or an IDE. You will need to have Python and the tkinter module installed on your computer.'''
