'''To increase the volume of a remote device, you would need 
to use specialized audio libraries or system-level audio 
control functions on the remote device. One possible approach 
is to use a remote desktop protocol (RDP) client to connect 
to the remote device and then use Python code to control the 
audio settings on the remote device.
Here is an example of how you can use the pyautogui library 
to control the volume on a remote device via an RDP 
connection:'''


import pyautogui
import rdp

# establish RDP connection
with rdp.RDP('hostname', 'username', 'password') as r:
    # increase volume by pressing volume up key
    for i in range(10):
        pyautogui.press('volumeup')

'''In the above example, the rdp library is used to establish 
an RDP connection to the remote device. Then, the pyautogui 
library is used to simulate the pressing of the "volume up" 
key ten times, effectively increasing the volume on the 
remote device. Note that this code assumes that the RDP 
client is already installed on the local machine and that the 
appropriate credentials are provided.'''
